# Home Value Estimation

[California housing](https://www.dcc.fc.up.pt/~ltorgo/Regression/cal_housing.html) is a dataset from the 1990s based on aggregated block-group data, with variables including average number of rooms per house per block group, the median income of residents, etc., the goal being to estimate the median house value for each block group. Unlike the [Adult example](https://github.com/BobMcDear/aplearn/tree/main/examples/adults), which you're advised to go through first, this folder only contains unannotated scripts, one in Python and the other in APL, with no comments or explanations. Running them trains and evaluates a [ridge regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridge_regression) model and prints the final [root mean squared error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_mean_square_deviation) on the validation set. The methods and algorithms here are described in detail in the [income prediction notebook](https://github.com/BobMcDear/aplearn/blob/main/examples/adults/apl.ipynb).

To run the Python script, please make sure you have scikit-learn and pandas installed.
