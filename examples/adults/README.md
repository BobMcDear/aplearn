# Income Prediction

The [Adult dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~delve/data/adult/adultDetail.html) contains census data gathered in 1994 relating to the income levels of different individuals and relevant factors, including age, marital status, occupation, etc. The two notebooks in this folder demonstrate an end-to-end machine learning workflow for predicting the individuals' annual salary, one in APL using APLearn to explain the usage and various functionalities of this library and the other in Python to validate APLearn's results.

To run the Python notebook, please make sure you have scikit-learn and pandas installed.
