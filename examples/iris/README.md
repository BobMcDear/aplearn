# Flower Clustering

The [_Iris_ flower dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/53/iris) is a small dataset comprising three species of the genus _Iris_, characterized by four features, namely, the length and width of the petals and sepals. Although this dataset is typically used to exhibit supervised classifiers, this example showcases [_k_-means clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering), an unsupervised learning method that splits the data into clusters based on the distance between samples. Ideally, there would be a one-to-one correspondence between categories and clusters, but in practice, that holds only for the simplest of datasets. In this case, running the evaluation script will demonstrate that _Iris setosa_ does get its own cluster, but the second and third clusters aren't as clear cut. This makes sense since _setosa_ is easier to distinguish than the other two partially-overlapping species.
